# Capstone Engagement Project 2
## Red Vs. Blue Team Project

In the second project week, you will work on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which you will play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. 

You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.
Then, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.


### Unit Objectives

This week's project will prompt you to apply knowledge of the following skills and tools:

* Penetration testing with Kali Linux.

* Log and incident analysis with Kibana.

* System hardening and configuration.

* Reporting, documentation, and communication.

### Lab Environment

* In this unit, you will be using the Red vs Blue lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services. 
* At the end of 20.3, we will set up a new Azure Lab Environment for the Forensics unit.
